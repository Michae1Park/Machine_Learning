  <description>
    <p>
      GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for
      numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical
      solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other
      numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities
      for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through
      its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write
      non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to
      Matlab so that most programs are easily portable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra
      problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary
      functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary
      differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily
      extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in
      Octave's own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in
      C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.
